kolawole Bafunmiso is a farmer. I am proud to be one of the people feeding the nation. Great Farmer! Great Nation! No Farmer! No Nation!
I'm into egg production to be precise. I have been into this business for the past eight years. I really thank God for how far HE has been with me. There are challenges which one cannot shy from. for instance, the recent persistent increase in the price of feed inputs.
The era of oil boom is far behind us. It is even a mirage!This is the right time for everyone to go back to the farm. Cocoa House in Ibadan was built out of money ralised from agricultural produce.
